## REDCap API and REDCapR

### REDCap API 

You have to be the role of project manager in order to use the API tool. You can check your role in the project by clicking the **User Right** button in the Applications panel. If your role in the project is project manager, then the **API** and **API Playground** buttons can be found in the Application panel. Otherwise please contact your REDCap administrator.

### Connect to REDCap API

You can access REDCap data using the API and bring it directly into R for analysis. The R package is [**REDCapR**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REDCapR/REDCapR.pdf). For using the package, you will need the following information from your specific REDCap project (accessible from the API tool):

* **URL**: *redcap_uri* 
* **API Token**: *You should contact your REDCap administrator to generate the API token. The API token is <span style="color:red">**ONLY**</span> for you and will work <span style="color:red">**ONLY**</span> with one project. This token allows special access to REDCap data and should <span style="color:red">**NOT**</span> be shared with others.*
* **Fields**: *Any specific fields or records of interest for the extraction*

Here is the R code for extracting all the project information: 

```{r}
library(REDCapR)
df <- redcap_read_oneshot(redcap_uri = uri,
                          token = token,
                          fields = 'project')$data
```

You can include the R code in your script. The output **df** is a data.frame.
